## Welcome to the GeoArke Team website!
GeoArke Team is composed by Me(Zoë) and my friend MustachedSquid, we don not intend to reveal our real names for now so meanwhile this is how we can be mentioned.
Our goal is to make a device that can show maps offline worldwide and comunicate on a P2P decentralized like network, this will be accomplished by using LoRa waves and some software.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GeoArkeTeam/GeoArke/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
